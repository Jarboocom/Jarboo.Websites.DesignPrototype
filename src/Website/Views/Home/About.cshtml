            <p>After starting a project, you get access to the Jarboo workspace. The project manager will assemble the people you need, depending on technology, project size and requirements. The team is updated as we go along, depending on your needs. </p>
            <p>In the Jarboo workspace you can communicate with a project manager, create tasks and see the status of existing tasks. If you need something done? Create a project or task, and we will get to it.</p>

            <p>When an estimate for a task has been accepted, we start development. On all tasks, there are five development phases which is covered below.  </p>

                    <p>The project manager is responsible for clearing all details about a given task. This is done by breaking down the task into subtasks, and understanding the full flow and scope. Often mockups are used in this stage.  </p>
                    <p>For most tasks, the project manager makes a (very) simple test matrix that describes how the test will be tested when it's done.</p>

                    <p>The architects role is to consider and make sure the implementation makes sense according to the overall picture.</p>

                    <p>The preferred way of working is by having pull requests, meaning the code will be reviewed by someone else than the developer himself, to make sure code quality is at a high standard.</p>
