                As we are trying to be the perfect mix between Employees, Consultants and Outsourcing,
                we have the following three key benefits described below. In addition, we also try to challenge your requirements and needs, to make sure you get critical feedback on projects and tasks.

            <p>After starting a project, you get access to the Jarboo Workspace. The project manager will assemble the team you need, depending on technology, project size and requirements. The team is updated as we go along, depending on your needs.</p>
            <p>In the Jarboo Workspace you can communicate with a project manager, create tasks and see the status of existing tasks. If you need something done? Create a project or task, and we will get to it.</p>

            <p>For complex tasks, there are often 3-5 different people in this process (or more, if it's a bigger project). For simpler tasks it would often be 2 people, to make sure things go smoothly and quickly.</p>

                    <p>The project manager is responsible for clearing all details about a given task. This is done by breaking down the task into subtasks and understanding the full flow and scope. Often mockups are used in this stage. </p>
                    <p>For most tasks, the project manager makes a simple test matrix that describes how the test will be conducted when it's done.</p>
